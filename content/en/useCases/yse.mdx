# E-commerce Evolutions — Ysé

[![Ysé site preview](/useCases/yse-paris.webp)](https://yse-paris.com/)

## 🧭 Role & Overall Context at Unlikely Technologies

**Unlikely Technologies – Technical Support Retainer (2022 – 2024)**  
As technical support lead across seven headless e-commerce sites, I handled client tickets (bugs, enhancements, optimizations) via ClickUp, ensuring quick turnaround and continuous availability.

*Project scope:*  
- **Scope:** Seven custom e-commerce platforms  
- **Mission:** Manage bugs, new feature requests, optimizations, calls  
- **Process:** Weekly triage and ongoing resolution  
- **Impact:** Freed senior engineers and maintained 100% uptime

## 👩‍💻 Key Contributions

### Modular Editorial Blocks & Navbar Overhaul  
**Context:** Enrich marketing pages and deliver a fully configurable navigation (mobile & desktop)  
**Challenge:** Iterate on legacy code under tight specs and deadlines  
**Actions:**  
1. Created reusable Prismic slices for editorial blocks  
2. Developed a CMS-driven Navbar component (icons, labels, multi-level structure)  
3. Integrated on mobile/desktop, linked front ↔ back via serializers, and conducted rigorous QA  

**Outcome:** More engaging pages and a fully customizable navbar without additional development, empowering the brand’s teams.

### User Tracking & Analytics  
**Context:** Need clear insights into key interactions (add-to-cart, product views, checkout flow)  
**Challenge:** Deploy and configure event hooks and coordinate with the analytics provider  
**Actions:**  
1. Workshops with data team and analytics vendor to define event schema  
2. Implemented client/server hooks to capture every key interaction  
3. QA-tested before production rollout  

**Outcome:** Reliable, actionable data enabling continuous optimization of the user journey.

### Multi-Market Management with Global-E  
**Context:** Modernize market handling and localization  
**Challenge:** Coordinate with Global-E, adapt middleware and components for each locale  
**Actions:**  
1. Built a country/currency selector modal and configured Global-E  
2. Updated Next.js and Prismic for new locales and currencies  
3. Added an API endpoint to list available markets from Shopify  
4. Ran end-to-end tests on redirects, cart, and checkout  

**Outcome:** Seamless international market expansion with full CMS and Shopify control.
