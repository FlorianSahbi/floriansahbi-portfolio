# Fixes & Integrations — Nina Ricci

[![Nina Ricci site preview](/useCases/nina-ricci.webp)](https://www.ninaricci.com/)

## 🧭 Role & Overall Context at Unlikely Technologies

**Unlikely Technologies – Technical Support Retainer (2022 – 2024)**  
As technical support lead across seven headless e-commerce sites, I managed client tickets (bugs, fixes, optimizations) via ClickUp, ensuring rapid triage and resolution and full service uptime.

*Project scope:*  
- **Scope:** Seven custom e-commerce sites  
- **Mission:** Handle bug fixes, new features, optimizations, calls  
- **Process:** Weekly prioritization and ongoing resolution  
- **Impact:** Freed senior engineers for strategic work

## 👩‍💻 Key Contributions

### Product Page Rendering Reliability  
**Context:** Some product pages failed to render despite correct CMS content  
**Challenge:** Quickly isolate the issue without downtime  
**Actions:**  
1. Inspected Prismic data and locales  
2. Reproduced the bug in a staging environment to trace back-end → front-end flow  
3. Analyzed the data serializer and compared with functional specs  
4. Fixed the front-end mapping and adjusted serialization logic  

**Outcome:** Instant restoration of all product pages, zero regressions, seamless production release.

### Dynamic Size Guide  
**Context:** No editable size guide component deployable per page  
**Challenge:** Design a reusable, CMS-driven component that’s easy to update  
**Actions:**  
1. Modeled a structured Prismic slice for size guide content  
2. Built a React component configurable per product type and device  
3. Integrated a sidebar panel to display the guide on product pages  

**Outcome:** Total contributor autonomy (updates in minutes), consistency across pages, improved UX.

### Native Localization Handling  
**Context:** Inconsistent redirects to correct language and currency  
**Challenge:** Implement reliable locale detection (cookie, browser) without extra requests  
**Actions:**  
1. Set up a Next.js **middleware** to detect locale from cookie or HTTP header  
2. Configured redirection rules based on user profile and Shopify settings  
3. Ran test scenarios for cookies, browser language, and geolocation  

**Outcome:** Users land in the correct language and currency every time, reducing errors and back-and-forth.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Vercel** (previews & deployments)  
- **Prismic** (Headless CMS)  
- **Shopify** (Admin API, Storefront API)  
- **SCSS**  
- **ClickUp**, **Figma**, **Algolia**, **Slack**, **Doppler**

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Maintained strong Core Web Vitals (Chrome UX Report, April 2025):  
- **LCP:** 3 s  
- **INP:** 88 ms  
- **CLS:** 0.99  
- **FCP:** 0.6 s  
- **TTFB:** 0.2 s
