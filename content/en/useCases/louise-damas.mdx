# Rebuild Headless Shopify × Storyblok × Next.js — Louise Damas

[![Louise Damas site preview](/useCases/louise-damas.webp)](https://louisedamas.fr)

## 🧭 Context

At Unlikely Technologies, I joined the Louise Damas project to support the tech lead on the headless rebuild (Next.js × Storyblok × Shopify). During the rebuild phase, I created and integrated modular front-end blocks. Post-launch, I served as technical lead on retainer: maintenance, client support, and continuous enhancements.

## 👩‍💻 Key Contributions

### Phase 1: Rebuild Support  
**Context:** Paired integration to establish the site’s modular foundation  
**Challenge:** Build pixel-perfect, CMS-driven blocks (navigation, text & image sections, multiple variants) while learning Next.js × Storyblok  
**Actions:**  
1. Reviewed ClickUp tickets and clarified requirements with the tech lead and PM  
2. Developed modular React/Next.js blocks (desktop & mobile) from Figma designs  
3. Configured Storyblok content types for each block (text, image, CTA, variants)  
4. Linked front ↔ back via serializers to ensure data consistency  

**Outcome:** A fully modular platform enabling the client to create pages independently and accelerate marketing initiatives.

### Phase 2: Technical Lead (Post-Rebuild)  
**Context:** Transitioned to a retainer model for stability and ongoing updates  
**Challenge:** Act as sole technical point of contact, handle most internal/external requests, and assume greater responsibilities  
**Actions:**  
1. Attended frequent client calls to validate technical feasibility and refine specs  
2. Implemented user-tracking hooks and collaborated with analytics provider  
3. Created MJML email templates and laid the groundwork for a reusable in-house email module  
4. Enhanced existing blocks: new features, bug fixes, and targeted optimizations  

**Outcome:** Strengthened client relationship and delivered rapid updates with zero regressions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Next.js** (TypeScript, ISR, SSR, SSG)  
- **Vercel** (previews & deployments)  
- **Prismic** (Headless CMS)  
- **Shopify** (Admin API, Storefront API)  
- **SCSS**  
- **ClickUp**, **Figma**, **Algolia**, **Slack**, **Doppler**

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Since rebuild, maintained strong Core Web Vitals (Chrome UX Report, April 2025):  
- **LCP:** 1.1 s  
- **INP:** 45 ms  
- **CLS:** 0.01  
- **FCP:** 0.6 s  
- **TTFB:** 0.2 s

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

> This dual role—front-end development during rebuild and ongoing technical lead—was my first major responsibility at Unlikely. I honed my headless architecture expertise, CMS-driven development, and technical project management skills.
