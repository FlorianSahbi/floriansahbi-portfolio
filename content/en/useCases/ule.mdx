# Support & Optimizations — Ulé Beauty

[![Ulé Beauty site preview](/useCases/ule-beauty.webp)](https://www.ulebeauty.com/)

## 🧭 Role & Overall Context at Unlikely Technologies

**Unlikely Technologies – Technical Support Retainer (2022 – 2024)**  
As technical support lead across seven headless e-commerce sites, I managed client tickets (bugs, fixes, optimizations) via ClickUp to ensure fast resolution and continuous uptime.

*Project scope:*  
- **Scope:** Seven bespoke e-commerce sites  
- **Mission:** Handle bug fixes, optimizations, and feature requests  
- **Process:** Weekly ticket triage and ongoing resolution  
- **Impact:** Ensured high performance and availability

## 👩‍💻 Key Contributions

### Bambuser Live Shopping Integration  
**Context:** Client wanted live shopping directly on product pages  
**Challenge:** Adapt Bambuser to headless Next.js & Storyblok without compromising performance  
**Actions:**  
1. Reviewed Bambuser docs and defined use cases with client  
2. Built a CMS-driven Storyblok component for live-shopping button and video previews  
3. Loaded script asynchronously via dynamic import and Next.js `beforeInteractive` strategy  
4. Exposed configurable options (icons, labels, text) in the back office  

**Outcome:** A toggle-on live-shopping feature requiring no code changes, fully controlled by marketing, with zero impact on initial render.

### Core Web Vitals Audit & Tuning  
**Context:** Google monitoring flagged slow performance on key pages  
**Challenge:** Pinpoint and eliminate bottlenecks without breaking features  
**Actions:**  
1. Ran Lighthouse audits on critical pages  
2. Incrementally removed and reintroduced elements to isolate slow components  
3. Deferred non-essential scripts and lazy-loaded off-screen images  
4. Monitored production impact via Vercel Analytics  

**Outcome:** Eliminated alerts and significantly improved user experience.

### German Market Launch  
**Context:** Expand to German-speaking customers with local currency support  
**Challenge:** Enable German locale in Shopify, adapt Next.js & Storyblok, and verify third-party compatibility  
**Actions:**  
1. Configured German locale in Shopify and Next.js i18n settings  
2. Updated Storyblok serializers and component translations  
3. Tested all third-party services (Bambuser, Provenance) under German locale  
4. Conducted end-to-end UX tests and rolled out progressively  

**Outcome:** Successful launch of the German market with translated catalog and euro payments, live without issues.

- **SCSS**
