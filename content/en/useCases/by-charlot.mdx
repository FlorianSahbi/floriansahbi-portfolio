# Functional Enhancements — By Charlot

[![By Charlot site preview](/useCases/by-charlot.webp)](https://www.bycharlot.com/)

## 🧭 Role & Overall Context at Unlikely Technologies

**Unlikely Technologies – Technical Support Retainer (2022 – 2024)**  
As the technical support lead for seven custom e-commerce sites (including Louise Damas, Nina Ricci, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Withenew, etc.), I collaborated with project managers to manage client tickets (bugs, fixes, optimizations) via ClickUp. This structured process ensured optimal response times and freed up senior engineers, guaranteeing 100 % uptime even during peak periods.

*Project scope:*  
- **Scope:** Seven bespoke e-commerce sites (Louise Damas, Nina Ricci, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Withenew, etc.)  
- **Mission:** Handle client tickets (bug fixes, new features, optimizations, calls)  
- **Process:** Weekly prioritization and ongoing resolution in ClickUp  
- **Impact:** Freed technical leads for major rebuilds and maintained full service availability

## 👩‍💻 Key Contributions

### Hero Module Implementation  
**Context:** Needed an impactful, fully configurable homepage banner for the marketing team  
**Challenge:** Build a reusable component with numerous variants, ensuring reliable handling of all use cases  
**Actions:**  
1. Converted design mockups into code  
2. Developed a React/Next.js component configurable for image, headline, and CTA  
3. Configured the corresponding Storyblok slice for content editors  
4. Conducted cross-breakpoint testing and refined CSS/SCSS

**Outcome:** Marketing teams gained full autonomy to update the banner without developer help, accelerating time-to-market and boosting user engagement on the homepage.

### Product Variant Extension  
**Context:** Add new engraving options to multiple “plants” product lines  
**Challenge:** Quickly grasp the brand’s intricate business logic  
**Actions:**  
1. Added metafields and variants in Shopify Admin  
2. Defined matching fields in Storyblok  
3. Built API calls to fetch and render the new options  
4. Updated Next.js templates for dynamic variant display

**Outcome:** Client can now manage engraving variants independently, eliminating technical bottlenecks.

### Functional Scoping with Client  
**Context:** Launch a major new feature  
**Challenge:** Define clear scope and realistic timeline to prevent scope creep  
**Actions:**  
1. Joined scoping calls with client and PM  
2. Drafted detailed functional specifications  
3. Developed the new business vertical per spec  
4. Held regular check-ins, adapted to feedback, and maintained open communication with the client team

**Outcome:** Rapid scope validation, fewer revisions, and on-time delivery.
